Feature: check to make sure the right ports are open on our server
  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following profile:
      |name    | value          |
      |host    | 10.48.10.170   |

  Scenario: Verify server is open on expected ports
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
    """
    nmap -F <host>
    """
    Then the output should match:
    """
    80/tcp open
    """
